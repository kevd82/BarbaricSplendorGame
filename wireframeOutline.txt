[REQUIRED] Name: Kevin Deming
[REQUIRED] Project Title: Barbaric Splendor Card Maker
[REQUIRED] Project Stack: MERN
[REQUIRED] GitHub Repo Link: (empty) https://github.com/kevd82/BarbaricSplendorGame

[REQUIRED] Project Description: This will be the beginnings of a project that will have online resources for a game that I am developing using an existing ruleset - 
to start with I plan to create a application that will allow users to create cards to use in their games with the existing ruleset.

[REQUIRED] New Programming Concept(s) (1)I'm Planning to Learn: I will need to learn how to transform the data display I create into an image that can be saved for printing.
(2) I plan a dropdown menu to select character abilities to be displayed on the card and will need to learn how to have a description of each ability display when that option
is hovered over(maybe right-click?) (3)I will need to learn how to allow only the creator of each card to be able to edit/delete.

[REQUIRED] Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2):Card information input and database storage, designging dropdown menus for abilities and stat numbers, login and registration
- 

[REQUIRED] Week 2 Features (to show at first office hour/lecture of Week 3): Displaying info in card format and allowing for saving as image by user so they can print it, css for both cards and the site itself.
- ***Finish CSS work (could be Bootstrap or another framework too instead of CSS)***
- 

[REQUIRED] Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...): In the future, there will be variations on the cards for my own game in addition to this initial set, so perhaps working on that.
